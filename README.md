# User Admin UI

This is a cloned project, being re-purposed for user admin for Back2bikes

It will usually be used to connect to the database of another meteor app. Let's say that you are running another meteor app on port 3000, then you will run this with the following command:

`MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:3001/meteor meteor --port 3050`

This will connect to the mongo database on port 3001

Log in to this app with the user:

user: admin@test.com
password: admin
